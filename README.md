# FlappyBird
The objective of Flappy Bird was straightforward: players had to control a small bird by tapping the screen to make it flap its wings and navigate through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The bird constantly moved to the right, and the only control was to make it fly higher or lower by tapping.
